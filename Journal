-Ended up not doing much because android studio didn't finish dowloading. Also need to dowload the java develper kit which is needed to run
android studio. I am going to dowload android studio at home and put it on a flash drive to see if i can start working on a ui tomorrow.

-ran into multiple problems today. First, the cpu on our computer can't support the emulator, so we can't test anything unless we plug our
actually phones and test it there. another problem is taht github still isn't working and we can't really find a way to fix this problem.

-Goal- set up github & start creating a simple ui for testing
-We have succesfully connected our Android Studio project to github, so now we can pull and push the project, so multiple peopel can work
on it at the same time. Also, we finished setting up a simple ui so we can see the differnce between coding in android. We still have a lot
about android and android studio's differences between eclipse.
